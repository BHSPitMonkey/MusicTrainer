A web application made for practicing reading sheet music, pitch recognition / ear training, and perhaps more.

## Features

- üì± **Works on any mobile or desktop device with a browser** (no installation necessary)
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Works offline** (so you can keep practicing in the subway, on a plane, etc.)
- üéπ **Supports MIDI keyboards** (and other input devices)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è **Supports installation** ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile and run full-screen from your app launcher)

## Practice Modes

    <td>
      <h4>Sight Reading Practice</h4>
      <p>Read the note(s) on the staff and see how quickly you can identify it. Instead of using the on-screen keys, you can also connect a MIDI keyboard and play the notes physically (Android or desktop only). Answering correctly generates a random new question.</p>

      <h4>Perfect Pitch Practice</h4>
